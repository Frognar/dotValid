# dotValid - Functional Validation for C#

[![.net workflow](https://github.com/Frognar/dotValid/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Frognar/dotValid/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

dotValid is a small, focused C# library designed to make your validation logic more robust and user-friendly by embracing a functional approach. Unlike traditional validation methods that often stop at the first error, dotValid allows you to accumulate all validation errors, providing a complete picture of what went wrong.

## Why dotValid?
Imagine a user filling out a form with multiple fields. If you validate each field sequentially and stop on the first error, the user has to correct one error, resubmit, only to find another. With dotValid, you can validate all fields and present every error at once, leading to a much smoother user experience.

This library is particularly useful for:
- Validating incoming API requests.
- Form validation in desktop or web applications.
- Any scenario where you want to provide comprehensive error feedback.
